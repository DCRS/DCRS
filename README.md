# Modern "Bios"
When start the computer, this kernel will work like a BIOS does, verifying all components and calling the OS for boot.

But this is very different than a BIOS! When finish the verify of hardware, this system will search for operating systems installed in all connected storage devices. Then, this kernel will show an boot-selector screen for selecting OS to run from each storage device, and will run the interface of OS, working as an kernel.

Yes, this firmware is an kernel that uses interface in HTML5/CSS/JavaScript and compatible only with modern operating systems compatible with the technology.

How you work modern operating systems compatible with this system? I'ts simple. As base specs, an modern OS will need to be writen in HTML5+Javascript, and contain a splash/boot screen for loading the system page of OS, and, obviously, the referred system page.

You can start understanding an modern OS or making your own at [this project hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/DaniellMesquita/Modern-OS).
